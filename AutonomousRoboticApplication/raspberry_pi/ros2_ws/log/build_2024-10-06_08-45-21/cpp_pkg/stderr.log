CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory D:/Shared Folders/Uni/courses/Arm stm/Graduation Project/Autonomous Robotic System/AutonomousRoboticApplication/raspberry_pi/src/ros2_ws/build/cpp_pkg/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/aliadel/Documents/Autonomous-Robotic-System/AutonomousRoboticApplication/raspberry_pi/src/ros2_ws/build/cpp_pkg where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "D:/Shared Folders/Uni/courses/Arm stm/Graduation Project/Autonomous Robotic System/AutonomousRoboticApplication/raspberry_pi/src/ros2_ws/src/cpp_pkg/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/aliadel/Documents/Autonomous-Robotic-System/AutonomousRoboticApplication/raspberry_pi/src/ros2_ws/src/cpp_pkg/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
