## Project Scope and Introduction

Autonomous robotic systems operate by integrating subsystems such as sensors, actuators, control algorithms, and decision-making components. They can perceive the environment, make decisions, and execute tasks without real-time human input. This project explores these systems through the development of hardware components and software frameworks, particularly focusing on **ROS2** (Robot Operating System 2), which enables seamless interaction between the physical world and robotic behavior.
